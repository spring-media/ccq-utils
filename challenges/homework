Imagine that you are assigned to work with a dev team to level up their security. They have this legacy and most 
likely vulnerable application that needs to be secured. The teams are very agile and do continuous deployment.
The application can be found here: https://github.com/wo1f1ow/dvna

1. How would you secure the application and implement security controls so that it would be safe to deploy to the public/production environment? 
Feel free to clone or fork the repository (to implement any security controls on it) and be ready to discuss your implemented solution with us.
2. What kind of vulnerabilities do you see in the repository? Given the limited resources in the dev team, how should team proceed?
