Your task is to create a plan of action to secure the DVNA application by implementing security controls and best practices 
that will mitigate or eliminate all the vulnerabilities present in the application. The application is hosted on Github, and you can access it using the 
following link: https://github.com/wo1f1ow/dvna
You should provide a detailed plan of action on how you would secure the application and fix all the issues.

Please keep in mind that we are looking for a complete and practical solution that can be applied to any application. 
Your plan of action should include:

- Identification of vulnerabilities present in the DVNA application.
- Prioritization of the vulnerabilities based on severity.
- Security controls and best practices to mitigate or eliminate the identified vulnerabilities.
- Any additional recommendations for improving the overall security of the application.

Please be ready to talk about your solution during the next interview, outlining each step of the process (bonus points if you have any supporting 
documentation, such as diagrams or code snippets).

We look forward to reviewing your plan of action and evaluating your technical skills and knowledge of securing the vulnerable application.
